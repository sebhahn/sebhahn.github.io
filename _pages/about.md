I'm a PhD student and a project assistant at the [Department for Geodesy and Geoinformation at TU Wien](http://www.geo.tuwien.ac.at/). My research interest is retrieving geophysical parameter from active microwave remote sensing instruments. I'm one of the key developers for the software package WARP (soil Water Retrieval Package), which represents a Python implementation of the TU Wien soil moisture retrieval algorithm.
  
My current research is focused on model calibration and algorithmic improvements in the TU Wien soil moisture retrieval algorithm. I'm also interested in geophysical validation, software development, parallel processing and machine learning.
