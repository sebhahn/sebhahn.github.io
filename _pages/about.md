I'm a senior scientist at the [Department for Geodesy and Geoinformation at TU Wien](http://www.geo.tuwien.ac.at/). My research interest is retrieving geophysical parameter from active microwave remote sensing instruments. I'm one of the key developers for the software package WARP (soil Water Retrieval Package), which represents a Python implementation of the EUMETSAT H SAF TU Wien soil moisture retrieval algorithm.
  
My current research is focused on model calibration and algorithmic improvements in the soil moisture retrieval algorithm using ASCAT on-board the series of Metop satellites. I'm also interested in geophysical validation, software development, parallel processing and machine learning.
